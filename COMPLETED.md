## Session 2 — Build editor UI

- Game-data IPC bridge: main process reads `data/game-data/*.json` once (`src/main/game-data/load-game-data.ts`,
  cached in memory) and exposes it to the renderer via `window.gw2GameData.getAll()`
  (`src/main/ipc/game-data-ipc.ts`, `src/preload/index.ts`), mirroring the existing
  `window.gw2Storage` seam. `GameDataStoreProvider`/`useGameData` (`src/renderer/state/game-data-store.tsx`)
  loads it once and exposes lookup maps/selectors (specializations by profession, major/minor
  traits by specialization, skills by profession+slot).
- Build editor UI (`src/renderer/components/build-editor/`): `ProfessionSelect`, `TraitsEditor`
  (3 specialization lines, enforces at most one elite spec equipped and no duplicate lines,
  3-tier major trait radio picker per line, minor traits shown read-only), `SkillsEditor`
  (heal/utility×3/elite, filtered by profession + GW2 API `slot` field, prevents picking the
  same utility skill in two slots), `EquipmentEditor` (16 gear slots × itemstat picker), and a
  `BoonUptimePanel` stub documenting the planned calculator shape (per-boon source list with
  computed duration) without implementing it yet.
- `BuildEditorView` orchestrates all of the above with local draft state; changing profession
  resets specializations/skills (they don't carry over between professions). Wired into
  `BuildsView` — clicking a build (or "+ New build") opens the editor; Save round-trips through
  `builds-store`'s new `createBuild`/`updateBuild` (replacing the old single-purpose
  `createDummyBuild`).
- Data quality fix: 13 of 191 itemstat entries from the live API have an empty `name` string
  (deprecated/internal stat combos) — filtered out of the equipment picker rather than shown as
  blank options.
- Verified end-to-end via a scripted Playwright/Electron launch (not committed): create a build,
  pick a profession/specialization/trait tier/skill/equipment stat, save, confirm it appears in
  the list, reopen it, and confirm every selection persisted through SQLite. No console/page
  errors during the run.

### Scoping notes carried into TODO.md

- Confirmed with the user: boon/condition calculator should mirror gw2skills.net for a single
  build (list every source + computed duration from boon duration/concentration/consumables),
  with a later squad-view mode showing all 5 party sources per boon. Needs a real GW2 API
  `Fact`-parsing layer (not hand-written rules) and WvW-specific balance numbers (not PvE) —
  both still open. Target first-pass party comp and full detail captured in TODO.md.

## Session 1 — Scaffolding & data-layer groundwork

- Project scaffold: Electron + React + TypeScript via `electron-vite`, with `src/main`
  (Electron main process), `src/preload` (contextBridge IPC surface), `src/renderer` (React
  app, no Electron APIs), and `src/shared` (types + storage interface usable from anywhere).
  ESLint (flat config) + strict TypeScript (`npm run typecheck`) wired up. `npm run dev`
  launches the Electron shell with the React app inside it.
- GW2 static game data pipeline: `scripts/fetch-game-data.ts` (run via
  `npm run fetch-game-data`) pulls professions, specializations, traits, skills, and itemstats
  from the public GW2 API v2, batches bulk `ids=` requests (200/batch) with retry/backoff, and
  writes normalized JSON to `data/game-data/`. Verified against the live API: 9 professions, 81
  specializations, 999 traits, 4702 skills, 191 itemstats. Documented in `docs/game-data.md`.
- Core data model: `Build`, `SquadComp`, and static game data types (`Profession`,
  `Specialization`, `Trait`, `Skill`, `ItemStat`) defined in `src/shared/types/`.
- Local storage layer: SQLite (via `better-sqlite3`, N-API-based for ABI stability across
  Node/Electron versions) behind a `StorageAdapter`/`Repository<T>` interface in
  `src/shared/storage/`. Builds/squad comps are stored as JSON blobs keyed by id (avoids a
  premature relational schema for still-evolving nested shapes). Renderer never touches SQLite
  directly — it goes through a preload-exposed `window.gw2Storage` bridge over IPC, which is
  the seam a future Capacitor storage plugin will implement instead.
- Minimal UI shell: Builds/Squads nav, with a working create → save (SQLite) → list → persist
  across restart round trip on the Builds view (Squads view is a placeholder).
- Verified end-to-end via a scripted Playwright/Electron launch (not committed — one-off
  verification): app window opens, "Create dummy build" persists through SQLite, and the build
  is still present after a full app restart.

### Bugs hit and fixed during setup (worth remembering)

- Electron's main process has known ESM named-export interop issues with the native `electron`
  module (`import { BrowserWindow } from 'electron'` throws "does not provide an export named
  ..." under Node ESM, including inside `@electron-toolkit/utils`). Fixed by forcing CJS output
  (`.cjs` extension) for the main/preload bundles in `electron.vite.config.ts`, regardless of
  the root `package.json`'s `"type": "module"`.
- `better-sqlite3`'s native binding is compiled against a specific Node/V8 ABI. The version
  installed by default (11.x) doesn't compile against Electron 43's newer V8 API at all, and
  even when it does compile, an ABI built for the system Node ≠ the ABI Electron bundles
  internally — a silent crash (unhandled promise rejection) on `new Database()` at startup with
  no visible window. Fixed by upgrading to `better-sqlite3@^13` (N-API, ABI-stable across
  Node/Electron versions) and wiring `electron-builder install-app-deps` as a `postinstall`
  script so native deps are always rebuilt/reprovisioned for Electron's ABI after `npm install`.
